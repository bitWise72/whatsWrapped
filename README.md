## Chat Analysis

WhatsWrapped analyzes your chat data to extract:

- Message Statistics: Total messages, messages per user, average message length
- User Behavior: Activity index (how much someone talks), emoji usage, caps lock ratio
- Temporal Patterns: Busiest hours, night owl members, most active days
- Content Analysis: Most discussed topics, common phrases, conversation patterns
- Group Dynamics: Member interactions, activity moments, group mood

## Privacy and Security

- Local Processing: Chat files are processed entirely in your browser
- No Cloud Storage: Your chat data is never stored on our servers
- AI Mode Exception: When using AI-powered mode, chat context is sent to Gemini API
- Transparent: Users are explicitly informed about data handling

## Deployment

This project is deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com) and can be accessed at https://whatwrapped.vercel.app

### Deploy Your Own Instance

#### Using Vercel CLI

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI globally
npm install -g vercel

# Navigate to project directory
cd whatsWrapped

# Deploy to production
vercel --prod
```

#### Using Vercel Dashboard

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Go to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.app)
3. Click "New Project"
4. Import your GitHub repository
5. Configure environment variables
6. Deploy

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory (for local development):

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_publishable_key
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
```

For AI-powered features, you'll need:
- Gemini API key (for AI content generation)
- Supabase project with configured Edge Functions

## Slide Types

### Intro Slide
Introduces the group with personalized context about their communication style

### Yapper Slide
Highlights the member who sent the most messages with witty commentary

### Timeline Slide
Celebrates the group's most chaotic day with context-aware descriptions

### Night Owl Slide
Identifies and roasts the members who chat at ungodly hours

### Drama Slide
Counts the dramatic moments (ALL CAPS messages) and their triggers

### Roast Slide
A humorous, personalized roast of the entire group based on their behavior

### Report Card
A fun "school report card" grading the group on various metrics with a principal's note

## Troubleshooting

### Chat File Not Recognized
- Ensure you exported the chat from WhatsApp (not a screenshot or other format)
- Try exporting without media files for faster processing

### AI Generation Failing
- Check if your API key is properly configured
- Ensure you have sufficient credits with the AI service
- The app will fall back to template-based content if AI fails

### Slow Performance
- Large chat exports (10,000+ messages) may take longer to process
- Try with a smaller subset of your chat history
